# Permutation-Combinations

🔢 Permutations and Combinations Program

This project demonstrates the calculation of permutations and combinations using a simple programming approach. These concepts are widely used in mathematics, probability, statistics, and data science to determine the number of possible arrangements and selections from a given set of items.

📌 Concepts Covered

Permutation (P) → Arrangement of items where the order matters.
Combination (C) → Selection of items where the order does not matter.


🧪 Program Features

Takes input values of n (total items) and r (selected items).
Calculates permutation and combination using formula-based logic.
Displays the results clearly for easy understanding.
Works as a foundational example for probability and counting principle problems.


🎯 Why This Is Useful

Permutations and combinations are essential for:
Solving probability-based problems
Performing statistical analysis
Calculating possible outcomes in events
Applications in machine learning, optimization, and operations research
